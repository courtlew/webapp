## Working title: On the front lines of mental crises
### Subhead: The SFPD averages 41 calls a day for someone in a mental health crisis, and serious incidents have risen sharply

### 5150 Maps
Two to three maps side-by-side showing the overall 5150 increase in San Francisco for the last 10 years, with a brief text description of what a 5150 hold is.

### See Your Neighborhood
(Below the maps)
This section has a dropdown menu of San Francisco neighborhoods. Selecting a neighborhood takes the user to a page with details for that neighborhood. That page will include a map of 5150 incidents in the last 30 days and a time series showing how the number has changed in the last 10 years. Next to each of those graphics will be a key number (the number of 5150s and the percent change over time) in large font, similar to [this page.](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/harvey)
